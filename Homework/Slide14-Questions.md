# Slide 14 Questions

### 1. Understand the differences between Google Dataflow and Dataproc
* __Google Dataflow:__ place to run Apache Beam based jobs, without the need to address the technicalities of running jobs on a cluster (such as work balancing and scaling), since  this is automatically done for you. With Google Dataflow you focus on the logical computation rather than how the runner works. Additionally, Dataflow provides base templates that simplify common tasks. Beams has the downside of only supporting _Python 2.7_.
* __Dataproc:__ provides you with a Hadoop Cluster and access to Apache Hadoop / Spark ecosystem. Indicated when the manual provisioning of clusters is necessary (as seen before, GD does it automatically) OR when there are dependencies to tools belonging to the aforementioned ecosystem.

### 2. Understand how a pipeline is created
To construct a pipeline, the program performs the following general steps:
- Creates a Pipeline object. 

`with beam.Pipeline(options=beam_options) as p`
- Uses a Read transform to create a PCollections for our pipeline data from an external source.

`| 'Feature extraction' >> feature_extraction`
- Applies transforms to each PCollection. Transforms can change, filter, group, analyze, or otherwise process the elements in a PCollection. Each transform creates a new output PCollection, to which we can apply additional transforms until processing is complete.

```
 | 'Predict' >> beam.ParDo(Predict(model_dir, 'ID'))
 | 'Format as JSON' >> beam.Map(json.dumps)
```
- Write the final output, transformed PCollections.

` | 'Write predictions' >> sink)`

### 3. Understand the learning task
*TODO*

### 4. Understand the contents of each script in the pipeline
* `data-extractor.py`: Downloads the SDF files.

* `preprocess.py`: Parses the SDF files to then count how many Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen and Nitrogen atoms a molecule has and then normalizes that values (from 0 to 1). Uses `tf.Transform` to find the minimum and maximum number of counts (full pass over the dataset). The process up to this phase can be nominated __Feature Extraction__. Splits the dataset into training (80%) and test (20%).

* `trainer/task.py`: Loads the data that was processed in the preprocessing phase and then uses the training dataset to train the model, and then uses the evaluation dataset to verify that the model accurately predicts molecular energy given some of the moleculeâ€™s properties.

* `predict.py`: Provide the model with inputs and it will make predictions. The pipeline can act as either a **batch pipeline** or a **streaming pipeline**. Batch pipeline is indicated when there are a large amount of predictions and the user can wait for all of them to finish. Streaming pipeline is indicated when the User is sending sporadic predictions and wants to get the results as soon as possible. The batch and streaming pipeline differ on the source and sink interactions.

* `publisher.py`: Parses SDF files from a directory and publishes them to the inputs topic.

* `subscriber.py`: Listens for prediction results and logs them.

### 5. Understand how to use transformations and estimators in Tensorflow

**TensorFlow Transformations** are great for preprocessing input data for TensorFlow, including creating features that require a full pass over the training dataset.

In the molecules example a Transform is used to make a full pass over the dataset and find the maximum and minimum count of molecules, using then the computed values to normalize the input data.


**Tensroflow Estimators** base themselves on the Estimator class, which wraps a model which is specified by a model function, which, given inputs and a number of other parameters, returns the operations necessary to perform training, evaluation, or predictions.

Estimators encapsulate the following actions:
* training
* evaluation
* prediction
* export for serving

### 6. Run the pipeline as is locally (run-local) and in the cloud (run-cloud) (are there any differences in performance?)

For smaller datasets, running them locally is much faster than running them on the cloud (makes sense as the communicaton with the cloud inuces overhead). However, to larger datasets, the local machine becomes slower than the cloud, since the cloud resources surpass the local machine resources. (**To check later, now that im rethinking, it will always be faster in laptop?? check..**)
